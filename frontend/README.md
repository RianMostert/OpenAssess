# Frontend – WHK6

This is the Next.js + React frontend for the WHK6 application. It provides the web interface for users to interact with the system.

## Quick Start

Run the frontend using Docker Compose (from the project root):

```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

Or run manually:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

Make sure to configure you .env.local file before running locally.
