# Backend – WHK6

This is the FastAPI backend for the WHK6 application. It handles API logic, database operations, and authentication.

## Quick Start

Run the backend using Docker Compose (from the project root):

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Or run it mannually:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Make sure to configure your `.env` file before running locally.
